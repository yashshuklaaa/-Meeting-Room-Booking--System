# Meeting Room Booking System

📝 Task Implementation Summary
Schemas: Designed Room and Booking schemas in MongoDB.

Conflict Handling: Backend checks for overlapping bookings.

Recurring Bookings: Optional, supports cancelling single instance, future instances, or entire series.

Frontend Logic:

Room selection is global.

Clicking a slot pre-fills the booking form.

Updates and deletions reflect immediately.

Rules Followed:

No overlapping bookings.

Slots freed after cancellation.

Modular, clean code structure.

Styling: Basic Tailwind CSS applied. Can be improved.


A web-based **Meeting Room Booking System** built with **MongoDB, Node.js, Express, and React (Vite)**.  
This system allows office employees to book rooms, update or cancel bookings, and optionally handle recurring meetings. The application prevents double-booking and keeps bookings consistent across rooms.
