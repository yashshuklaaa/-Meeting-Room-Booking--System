# Meeting Room Booking System

## üìù Task Implementation Summary

### Schemas
- **Room Schema**: Stores room details such as name, capacity, and location.
- **Booking Schema**: Stores booking details including room reference, start & end time, user, and recurrence info.
- **Explanation**: The schemas are designed to prevent conflicts and allow easy management of bookings.

### Conflict Handling
- **How It Works**: Backend checks for overlapping bookings before confirming a new booking.
- **Benefit**: Ensures that no two bookings overlap for the same room, maintaining consistency and avoiding double-booking issues.

### Recurring Bookings
- **Functionality**: Supports recurring bookings (e.g., weekly team meetings).
- **Cancellation Options**:
  - Cancel a single instance.
  - Cancel all future instances.
  - Cancel the entire series.
- **Implementation**: Recurrence rules stored in the backend using proper date handling.

### Frontend Logic
- **Room Selection**: Global across the booking form for consistency.
- **Slot Click Behavior**: Clicking a time slot pre-fills the booking form with relevant info.
- **Updates & Deletions**: Any changes reflect immediately in the UI for a smooth user experience.

### Rules Followed
- No overlapping bookings.
- Cancelled slots are freed and available for new bookings.
- Modular and clean code structure for easy maintenance.

### Styling
- **Current Status**: Basic styling using Tailwind CSS.
- **Future Improvement**: Can enhance UI/UX with better styling and animations


A web-based **Meeting Room Booking System** built with **MongoDB, Node.js, Express, and React (Vite)**.  
This system allows office employees to book rooms, update or cancel bookings, and optionally handle recurring meetings. The application prevents double-booking and keeps bookings consistent across rooms.

üîó API Endpoints
Rooms
GET /api/rooms ‚Äî Get all rooms.

Bookings
GET /api/bookings?start=YYYY-MM-DD&end=YYYY-MM-DD ‚Äî Get bookings within date range.

POST /api/bookings ‚Äî Create a booking.

PUT /api/bookings/:id ‚Äî Update a booking.

DELETE /api/bookings/:id?scope=all|future|instance&instanceDate=YYYY-MM-DD ‚Äî Delete booking(s) based on scope.

üíª Frontend Usage
RoomSelector: Select the room globally.

SlotGrid: Shows available (green) and booked (red) slots.

BookingForm: Create or update bookings. Automatically pre-fills when a slot is clicked.

BookingsList: Displays all bookings and allows deletion/updating.





Recurring booking rules use RRULE format (FREQ=WEEKLY;COUNT=10).

‚úÖ Conclusion
